Finding the longest sub-sequence of consecutive numbers in a given array and return its length
- create a function called IonConsecutive
- return zero if the array is empty
- sort the array
- define a variable called longestS that keeps track of the length of the longest consecutive integer array length and start with 1
- traverse of the array in for loop
- check if array elements are consecutive
- If consecutive, increase current length, if not, compare current consecutive length with longest- start new sequential sequence
- exit the for loop
- return longest consecutive length with max funciton
- give an array in main function
- Call the longConsecutive function
- Find the time complexity of sorting step, checking consecutive elements and total

the array is given by us and it has to be 1, 24, 5, 2, 12

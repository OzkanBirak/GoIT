Creating fibonacci series
- create a function called Fibo with an argument named as n
- check the base cases
- calculate Fibonacci terms with loop
- Take a number from the user in main function 
- return fibonacci term of this number 
- find the best case time complexity (big o notation)
- find the complexity of the loop 
- find the general time complexity

Output example: Enter the number: 6
Fibonacci term of the 6 is 8

<h2>How to stop doubting and start exercising regularly</h2>
<p>
  Thousands of people dream about having a nice body. They start doing sport,
  face challenges and quit it in a few weeks or even days. Why does it happen?
  The problem is that people often do too much physical activity when their body
  is not ready for this load. Without allowing any recovery time between
  exercise sessions, they get tired quickly and lose motivation. We believe that
  you should have a smooth start and focus on developing a habit of doing sport
  regularly. So, we offer you a few training programs for beginners.
